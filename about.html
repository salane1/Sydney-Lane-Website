        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>Sydney Lane is a long-time audiophile and pandemic-turned composer and multi-instrumentalist. She deems childhood <br>mother-daughter symphony orchestra dates and her father's Dropkick Murphys school morning car ride music as the <br>source of her creativity and initiation of what will be a life full of music. </p>
        <p>During the Covid-19 pandemic, Sydney found a new energy towards music creation, released a compilation of songs for <br>film on SoundCloud, and realized just how healing music can be. Neoclassical composers, like Philip Glass and Max <br>Richter, were inspirations for this new energy.</p>
        <p>Sydney wanted to continue playing as much as she was during the pandemic, after the pandemic. To avoid making music <br>her post-pandemic hobby, she transferred from St. Edward's in Austin, to Loyola University in New Orleans ('23) in hopes <br>of a career in the entertainment industry (i.e., music for film). At Loyola, she is studying Music Business and has taken <br>classes encompassing copyright law, digital audio production, artist and entertainment finance, popular music history, <br>and film scoring.</p>
